//: ## Lesson 6 Exercises - Classes, Properties and Methods

import UIKit

//: __Problem 1__
//:
//: __1a.__
//: The compiler is complaining because the class Animal has no initializers. Write an init method for the Animal class and quiet this error. Include a mechanism to initialize the length of the Animal's tail using the Tail struct provided.
struct Tail {
    let lengthInCm: Double
}

class Animal {
    let species: String
    let tail: Double

}
//: __1b.__
//: Instantiate and initialize a few different Animals.
var m_t = Tail(lengthInCm: 10.5)
var monkey = Animal(species: "monkey", tail: m_t)

//: __Problem 2__
//:
//: Below are the beginnings of the Peach class.
class Peach {
    let variety: String
    static var variaties = ["red peach", "yellow peach"]
    // Softness is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the softest

        }
    }
}

var freshPeach = Peach(variety: Peach.variaties[0], softness: 2)
print(freshPeach.ripen())
//: __2a.__
//: Add a type property to the Peach class called "varieties". It should hold an array of different types of peaches.
//:
//: __2b.__
//: Add an instance method called ripen() that increases the value of the stored property, softness, and returns a string indicating whether the peach is ripe.
//:
//: __2c.__
//: Create an instance of the Peach class and call the method ripen().

//: __Problem 3__
//:
//: __3a.__
//:Add the computed property, "cuddlability", to the class, FluffyDog. Cuddlability should be computed based on the values of the stored properties, fluffiness and droolFactor.
//var theFluffiestDog = UIImage(named:"fluffyDog")!

}

var dog = FluffyDog(name: "toto", fluffiness: 1, droolFactor: 10)
dog.chase("haha")

//: __3b.__
//: Instantiate and initialize an instance of the class, FluffyDog. Use it to call the method, chase().

//: __Problem 4__
//:
//: __4a.__
//: Write an instance method, bark(), that returns a different string based on the value of the stored property, size.
enum Size: Int {
    case Small
    case Medium
    case Large

    }
}

var newDog = ChattyDog(name: "bob", breed: "lablado", size: .Medium)
ChattyDog.speak(newDog)

//: __4b.__
//: Create an instance of ChattyDog and use it to call the method, bark().

//: __4c.__
//: Rewrite the method, bark(), as a type method and rename it speak(). Call your type method to test it out.

//: __Problem 5__
//:
//:__5a.__
//: Write an initialization method for the House class below.
enum Quality {
    case Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent
}

enum NaturalDisaster {
    case Earthquake
    case Wildfire
    case Hurricane
}

class House {
    let numberOfBedrooms: Int
    let location: Quality

            return true
        case .Hurricane:
            return false
        }
    }
}

//: __5b.__
//: Create an instance of the House class and use it to call the method, willStayStanding().  This method takes in a parameter of type NaturalDisaster and return a Bool indicating whether the house will stay standing in a given natural disaster.

//: __5c.__
//: Add a computed property called, "worthyOfAnOffer". This property should be a Bool, whose return value is dependent upon some combination of the stored properties, numberOfBedrooms and location.
