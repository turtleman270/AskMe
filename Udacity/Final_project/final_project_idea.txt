Personal Motivation:
1) What are you most passionate about? How might an app help?
- I always forget what is left in the freezer and food go bad without nitice. I need an app to remind me and send alert to me when they are about to go rotten.

Some problems for the current freezer app:
1) no barcode, itâ€™s not convenient to add food.
2) even if they have a barcode, items of international food are not reconized
3) how to solve the problem that they do not have a barcode,
4) send pictures(optional function)
5) generate a shopping list with items added according to their cetegory

Basic functions:
1) use scan bar to add food 
2) alert when items are about to expire ( calculate the suggested using speed)
3) no user autherization needed

Features:
